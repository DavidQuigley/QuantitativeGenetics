Title: Remove SNP effects from Affymetrix arrays using sequence data
Description: Gene expression microarrays measure the levels of messenger
    ribonucleic acid (mRNA) in a sample using probe sequences that hybridize with
    transcribed regions. These probe sequences are designed using a reference
    genome for the relevant species. However, most model organisms and all humans
    have genomes that deviate from their reference. These variations affect the
    microarray???s performance. Genetic experiments comparing individuals bearing
    different population-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms that intersect
    microarray probes are therefore subject to systemic bias, as the reduction
    in binding efficiency due to a technical artifact is confounded with genetic
    differences between parental strains. This problem has been recognized for some
    time, and earlier methods of compensation have attempted to identify probes
    affected by genome variants using statistical models. These methods may require
    replicate microarray measurement of gene expression in the relevant tissue in
    inbred parental samples, which are not always available in model organisms and
    are never available in humans. The equalizer package reduces probe hybridization
    bias from experiments performed on the Affymetrix microarray platform, allowing
    accurate assessment of germline influence on gene expression.
