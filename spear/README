spear is the command-line wrapper around the spear library functions
in the carmen library. The primary use for this code is to calculate 
spearman rank correlation, thus the name. Spear has numerous parameters
which let the user compare one probe vs. all of the rest, perform all-vs-all,
calculate the Genome-Wide Error Rate as in Churchill & Doerge Genetics 1994 
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7851788), calculate differential 
correlation between two groups of samples, etc.

BUILDING SPEAR

Spear requires the boost C++ library (boost.org).
In August 2014 spear was built with boost 1.56.0.
