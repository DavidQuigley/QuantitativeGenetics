In addition to Boost, eqtl is also dependent on the Rmath library, allowing us to 
calculate P value distributions using code from R (r-project.org). You can generate 
this library from source; from the source:

wget http://cran.cnr.berkeley.edu/src/base/R-3/R-3.1.1.tar.gz
gunzip R-3.1.1.tar.gz
tar -xf R-3.1.1.tar
./configure
./make
cd src/nmath/standalone
make static
sudo cp libRmath.a /usr/local/lib

Alternately, download it from
